## Personal Journal

Each student must maintain a very simple personal journal.

#### Why

Your journal is a simple, low-overhead mechanism for getting you to be
_reflective_, to think _deliberately_ and _systematically_ about your
progress in this course, and for you to communicate
that to your tutor.

#### When

From week two onwards, you need to **commit and push** your journal at least
**_five minutes before_** your scheduled lab time.  Thoughtfully completing the
journal is a requirement of the course and what's committed prior to your scheduled
lab will be assessed by your tutor and reflected in your class engagement mark.

#### What

Each week, **starting in week one**, you need to **fill in the table** below to answer five very simple
questions:
* Respond to the statement '**Overall, I am happy with how I am going in this course**' (`1` strongly disagree, `2` disagree, `3` neutral, `4` agree, `5` strongly agree).
* Respond to the statement '**Overall, my assignment group is working well**' (`1` strongly disagree, `2` disagree, `3` neutral, `4` agree, `5` strongly agree) (week 4 onwards).
* **What have I done** for this class in the week to date?
* **What will I do** for this class in the week to come?
* **What impediments do I see** to me making progress on my goals?

This is based loosely on the [scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development))
methodology often used in software engineering.   Your statements need only be  _brief_,
but they should be _carefully considered_.

The statements should be written with respect to the weeks before and after your
scheduled lab time.   The journal serves three purposes.   First, it helps *you* to be
deliberate and self-reflective about how you think you are doing in the course.   Second,
it helps your tutor understand how you're doing, making them better able to *help you*.
Third, it helps your lecturer understand how the whole class is doing, making him better
able to *help the whole class*.

**Thoughtful** and **concise** entries are best.
